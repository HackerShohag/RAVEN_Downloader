# RAVEN Downloader

A simple youtube video downloader that can download entire playlist. This is Ubuntu Touch application based on qt framework.

### Requirements:
        youtube-dl (currently not using due to bug)
        python3-pip
        ffmpeg
        yt-dlp (alternative of youtube-dl)

### Doesn't work (or hasn't fixed):
        Theme Management
        Download Location (currently using appData path (~/.local/share/raven.downloader.shohag))

N.B.: Please don't report these bugs right now. You may need to install some dependency manually. It's still in undergoing development. You can provide me testing data on telegram (t.me/HackerShohag).
